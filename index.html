                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I am a passionate and dedicated Special Needs Education professional with a strong background in teaching, mentorship, and adolescent mental health interventions. With a Bachelor's degree in Special Needs Education from Moi University and currently at University of Pittsburgh pursuing Non-Degree program and hands-on experience in both local and international programs, I bring a unique blend of academic expertise, practical teaching skills, and psychosocial support capabilities.</p>
                    <p>My career spans classroom teaching, mental health facilitation, and international cultural exchange, having served as a Fulbright Swahili Teaching Assistant and a Special Education and English Literature teacher at Kitengela School. I am highly skilled in designing and implementing individualized education plans (IEPs), conducting workshops, and providing one-on-one counseling to support learners with behavioral, emotional, and academic challenges.</p>
                    <p>Beyond academics, I have actively engaged in fellowships and leadership programs such as the Nivishe Mental Health Fellowship and Taifa Teule Leadership Program, equipping me with advanced skills in advocacy, child rights promotion, and gender-based violence prevention. I thrive in collaborative, multicultural environments and excel at fostering inclusive learning spaces that empower learners to achieve their full potential.</p>
                    <p>With strong interpersonal, counseling, and leadership abilities, I am committed to shaping individuals who are not only academically successful but also socially responsible and emotionally resilient.</p>
